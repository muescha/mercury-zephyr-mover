# Mercury Zephyr Mover

An MercuryMover clone with [Zephyros](https://github.com/sdegutis/zephyros) (thanks to [sdegutis](https://github.com/sdegutis) for this nice little tool).

With this app i can realize in one day what was my biggest wish for the paid app MercuryMover - but since years never got into the app: resize all childs windows to the same size.

Slate was at first on my focus, but the scripting language was too complicated. 

With Zephyrus you can use whatever language you like.
